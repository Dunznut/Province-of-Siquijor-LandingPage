		<ul>
	    		<p>Located in the Central Visayas region, Siquijor is the third smallest province in the Philippines. Legend tells of a “King Kihod” as the source of the island’s name. Old residents also called the island “Katugasan” from the Molave (“tugas”) trees that cover the hill. Another version also tells of a priest who came to the island by sailing and when he went back to Bohol he was asked by the people at the beach where he had been, and he answered “Sequor” which means to follow the waves, and was misheard by them as Siquijor.

				Discovered by Esteban Rodriguez and Juan Aguirre of the Legaspi Expedition in 1565, it was known to the Spanish conquistadors as Isla de Fuego or the  “Island of Fire” for Siquijor was literally lit by fireflies at night swarming the branches of its molave trees.

				Siquijor, the first parish, was established in1783 under the administration of secular clergymen. In the years that followed until 1877, the parishes of Canoan (Larena), Tigbawan (Lazi), Makalipay (San Juan) and Cangmeniac (Maria) were founded by Augustinian and Recollect priests.

				From 1854 to 1892, it was administered under the politico-militar province of Bohol. In 1892, it became a part of Negros Oriental and was made its sub-province in 1901. On September 17,1971, Siquijor was created as a province by RA 6396 with Larena as the capital. In 1972 or a year later, the capital was transferred to Siquijor town by Proclamation 1075.

				Since the olden times people believe the island to be mysterious because of the presence of folk healers and their 	practices of spiritualism and up to these days  people still come to witness the preparation of the brews and really try the medicinal powers of the herbs, from health problems to the potions for love and favor.

				Above all, it’s the Siquijodnon’s welcoming smile and warmth that make every visitor’s stay delightful and unforgettable.</p><br>
